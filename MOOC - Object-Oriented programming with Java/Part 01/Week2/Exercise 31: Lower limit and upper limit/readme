Create a program that asks the user for the first number and the last number and then prints all numbers between those two.

First: 5
Last: 8
5
6
7
8
        

If the first number is greater than the last number, the program prints nothing:

First: 16
Last: 12
        

Note: Remember that the lower and upper limits can also be negative!
