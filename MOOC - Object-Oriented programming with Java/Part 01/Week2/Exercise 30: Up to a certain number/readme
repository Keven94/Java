Create a program that prints all whole numbers from 1 to the number the user enters.

Up to what number? 3
1
2
3
        

Up to what number? 5
1
2
3
4
5
        

Tip: The number you read from the user now works as the upper limit in the condition of the while statement. Remember that in Java a <= b means a is less than or equal to b.
