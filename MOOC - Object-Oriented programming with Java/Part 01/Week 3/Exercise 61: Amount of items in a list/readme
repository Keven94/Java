Create the method public static int countItems(ArrayList<String> list) that returns the number of the items in the list. Your method should not print anything. Use a return statement to return the number as shown in the following example:

ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
list.add("Hallo");
list.add("Ciao");
list.add("Hello");
System.out.println("There are this many items in the list:");
System.out.println(countItems(list));
    


There are this many items in the list:
3
