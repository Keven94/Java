Create a program that asks for the user's name and says how many characters the name contains.

Type your name: Paul
Number of characters: 4
    

Type your name: Catherine
Number of characters: 9
    

Note!Your program should be structured so that you put the calculating of the name length in it's own method: public static int calculateCharacters(String text). The tests will be testing both the method calculateCharacters and the program overall.
