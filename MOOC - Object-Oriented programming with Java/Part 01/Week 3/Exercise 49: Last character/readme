Create a program that asks for the user's name and gives the last character.

Type your name: Paul
Last character: l
    

Type your name: Catherine
Last character: e
    

Note! Your program should be structured so that you put the search for the last character in its own method: public static char lastCharacter(String text). The tests will be testing both the method lastCharacter and the program overall.
