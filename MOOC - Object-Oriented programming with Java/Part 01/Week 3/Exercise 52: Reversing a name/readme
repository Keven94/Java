Create a program that asks for the user's name and prints it in reverse order. You do not need to create a separate method for this.

Type your name: Paul
In reverse order: luaP
    

Type your name: Catherine
In reverse order: enirehtaC
    

Hint: You can print one character using the command System.out.print()
