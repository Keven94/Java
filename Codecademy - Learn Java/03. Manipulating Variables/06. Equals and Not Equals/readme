So how would we validate our paycheck to see if we got paid the right amount?

We can use another relational operator to do this. == will tell us if two variables are equal:

double paycheckAmount = 620;
double calculatedPaycheck = 15.50 * 40;
System.out.print(paycheckAmount == calculatedPaycheck);
//this will print true, since paycheckAmount equals calculatedPaycheck

Notice that the equality check is two equal signs, instead of one. One equal sign, =, is how we assign values to variables! Itâ€™s easy to mix these up, so make sure to check your code for the right number of equal signs.

To check if two variables are not equal, we can use !=:

double balance = 20000.0;
double amountToDeposit = 620;
double updatedBalance = balance + amountToDeposit;
boolean balanceHasChanged = balance != updatedBalance;
//depositWorked holds true, since balance does not equal updatedBalance
