In our bank account example from the last exercise, we used + to add!

double balance = 20000.99;
double depositAmount = 1000.0;
double updatedBalance = balance + depositAmount;
//updatedBalance now holds 21000.99

If we wanted to withdraw from the balance, we would use -:

double withdrawAmount = 500;
double updatedBalance = balance - withdrawAmount;
//updatedBalance now holds 19500.99

Addition and subtraction work with ints as well!

int numPicturesOfCats = 60 + 24;

If you had 60 pictures of cats on your phone, and you took 24 more, you could use the above line of code to store 84 in numPicturesOfCats.
