1. Last exercise, we defined a new method, advertise(), but we didnâ€™t actually see it run.
We now have a Store class with advertise() defined.
Call the advertise() method on the lemonadeStand object in the main() method and see what the output is!

2. Now, call the advertise() method on the lemonadeStand object two more times. It should be called in the main() method three times total.
