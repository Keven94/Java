Great! When we add the startEngine() method to the Car class, it becomes available to use on any Car object. We can do this by calling the method on the Car object we created, for example.

Here is an example of calling a method on an object using the Car class:

class Car {

  String color;

  public Car(String carColor) {
    color = carColor;
  }

  public void startEngine() {
    System.out.println("Starting the car!");
    System.out.println("Vroom!");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args){
    Car myFastCar = new Car("red");
    myFastCar.startEngine();
  }
}

In the example above, we call the startEngine() method on the myFastCar object. This method call occurs inside the main() method. Running the program results in printing Vroom! to the output terminal.
