Creating and filling variables is a powerful concept that allow us to keep track of all kinds of data in our program.

In this lesson, we learned how to create and print several different datatypes in Java, which youâ€™ll use as you create bigger and more complex programs.

We covered:

    ints, which store whole numbers
    doubles, which store bigger whole numbers and decimal numbers
    booleans, which store true and false
    chars, which store single characters using single quotes.
    Strings, which store multiple characters using double quotes.
    Static typing, which is one of the safety features of Java
    Variable naming conventions.

Practice declaring variables and assigning values to make sure you have a solid foundation for learning more complicated and exciting Java concepts!
