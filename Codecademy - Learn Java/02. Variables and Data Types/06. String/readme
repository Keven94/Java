So far, we have learned primitive data types, which are the simplest types of data with no built-in behavior. Our programs will also use Strings, which are objects, instead of primitives. Objects have built-in behavior.

Strings hold sequences of characters. Weâ€™ve already seen instances of a String, for example when you printed out "Hello World".

Just like with a primitive, we declare the variable by specifying the type first:

String greeting = "Hello World";
