How do we answer questions like: What grade did you get on the test? What letter does your name start with?

The char data type can hold any character, like a letter, space, or punctuation mark.

It must be surrounded by single quotes, '.

For example:

char grade = 'A';
char firstLetter = 'p';
char punctuation = '!';
