We create objects (instances of a class) using a constructor method. The constructor is defined within the class.

Here’s the Car class with a constructor:

public class Car {
  public Car() {
  //constructor method starts after curly brace

    //instructions for creating a Car instance

  }
  //constructor method ends after curly brace

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // program tasks

  }
}

The constructor, Car(), shares a name with the class.

We create instances by calling or invoking the constructor within main(). This example assigns an instance to the variable ferrari:

public class Car {

  public Car() {
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    /*
    invoke a constructor using 
    'new', the name, and parentheses:
    new Car()
    */
    Car ferrari = new Car(); 
  }
}

As with other variable declarations, we specify the type: Car, and name: ferrari. Variables that reference an instance have a type of the class name.

We invoke the constructor method: Car(), and use the keyword new to indicate that we’re creating an instance. Omitting new causes an error.

This is the first time we’ve called a method that we’ve also defined. main() is run automatically and we did not define the println() method.

Introducing a second method is a big step in your programming journey, congratulations!
